There are eight motives, which are\n* socializing\n* social pressure\n* social approval\n* entertainment\n* passing time\n* relationship seeking\n* information seeking and \n* sexual experience. \n\nAfter computing the scores for each of them, we selected the highest score to determine the main motive of the Tinder User subset, displayed by figure \\@ref(fig:tinder-main-motives). Information seeking appears to be the strongest motivation (23 participants), followed by social pressure (16) and social approval, the main drive for 11 subjects. The results of Tinder motives scale might differ per country: there are different uses across countries of hookup applications, or more generally social networks (D' Silva & Atay, 2019). For example, our results are different from the results of Barrada and Castro (2020), run on a almost similar sample in Spain (18-26 young adults). Their 1261 university students ranked first pass time, entertainment and information seeking (curiosity). \n\n\n```{r tinder-main-motives, fig.cap=\"Tinder users' computed main motivations\", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nset.seed((1234))\nj <- mydata %>% group_by(Group) %>%\n  mutate(SocializingScore= (Socialiazing1+Socialiazing2)/2) %>% \n  mutate(SocPressureScore= (SocPress1+Socpress2)/2) %>% \n  mutate(SocApprovalScore= (Socapprov1 + Socapprov2)/2) %>% \n  mutate(EntertainmentScore= (Entertain2+Entetain1)/2) %>%\n  mutate(PassTimeScore= (PassTime1+PassTime2)/2) %>%    \n  mutate(RelSeekingScore= (RelSeek1+RelSeek2)/2) %>%\n  mutate(InfoSeekingScore= (InfoSeek1+InfoSeek2)/2) %>%\n  mutate(SexualExpScore= (SexualExp1+SexualExp2+SexualExp3)/3) %>%\n  mutate(SESscore= Rosenberg1+Rosenberg2+Rosenberg3+Rosenberg4+Rosenberg5+Rosenberg6+Rosenberg7+Rosenberg8+Rosenberg9+Rosenberg10) %>%\n  mutate(BASscore = (BAS1 + BAS2 + BAS3 + BAS4 + BAS5 + BAS6 + BAS7 + BAS8 + BAS9 + BAS10 + BAS11 + BAS12 + BAS13)) %>%\n  mutate(AIS_Attention = (Attention1+Attention2+Attention3+Attention4)/4) %>%\n  mutate(AIS_Motor = (Motor1+Motor2+Motor3)/3) %>%\n  mutate(AIS_FuturePlan = (FuturePlan1+FuturePlan2+FuturePlan3+FuturePlan4) /4) %>%\n  mutate(AISscore = AIS_Attention+AIS_FuturePlan+AIS_Motor)\n\ndf <- j %>% subset(select =c(1:11,66:79))\ndf1 <- df %>% filter(Group == \"User\" | Group == \"TUser\") %>% subset(select = c(1,12:19))\ndf1$TinderMainScore <- names(df1)[-1][max.col(df1[-1])]\nTinderMainMotive <- as.factor(df1$TinderMainScore)\ndf_full<- left_join(df,df1)\n\n\ndf1 %>% \n  group_by(TinderMainScore) %>%\n  summarise(n = n()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(TinderMainScore, -n) ,y= n, fill= TinderMainScore)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\",alpha=0.8) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n     title = \"Tinder users' computed main motivations\",\n     subtitle = \"The three main motives being information seeking, social pressure and approval\",\n     x = \"First motivation\",\n     y = \"Number of users\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n), size = 5, hjust = 3, vjust = 0, position = \"stack\")\n```\n\nTo refine this information, we decant by age of Tinder Users. The three main drives previously observed are quite homogeneously distributed by age group (information seeking in red, social approval in blue and social pressure in purple in the figure \\@ref(fig:age-main-motive) ). Relationship seeking seems to be a drive for younger Users in the present sample. As supposed in some online articles, the pressure of having his first relationship is strong and push young persons to adopt behaviors in order to align themselves to their peers: finding a boy/girlfriend (Francis, 2019). It is an potential hypothesis underlying this fact: we could add other non-explored here hypothesis, such as being more naive or sentimental around 20 years old. Some normative studies concerning the utility of having a relationship during Universitarian cursus  (Cheung, Lai and Wu, 2015) could be mentioned for another hypothesis: having a preferences to less commiting relationships during University.\n\n\n```{r age-main-motive, fig.cap=\"The motives per age of Tinder Users\", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}\nset.seed(1234)\n\ndf_full %>% filter(Group == \"User\" | Group == \"TUser\") %>%\n  group_by(Age, TinderMainScore) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(TinderMainScore,Age, fill= TinderMainScore)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = TinderMainScore)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size =10)) +\n   labs(\n     title = \"Type of relationship per age among Tinder Users subset\",\n     subtitle = \"Relation seeking seems to be a motive for younger Users\",\n     y=\"Age\", \n     x=\"Main motivation to have joined Tinder\"\n     )\n\n```\n\n\nDifferences exists in types of relationship among Tinder Users and Non Users. Let's define what signify open relationship and punctual sex. According to the dictionnary, open relationship is defined by one where an established couple has mutually agreed to share a non-monogamous lifestyle. This includes either or both parties having other sexual and/or romantic partners (open relationship | Dictionary.com, 2020). Hookups, here named \"punctual sex\", are defined by any form of intamicy with a member of the prefered sex who is not considered as a significant other (Urban Dictionary: hookup, 2020). \nAs presented by the fingure \\@ref(fig:relationship-age), punctual sexual relations is correlated with Tinder uses, as this form of relationship is the second most represented type in the respective subset per age. In addition, open relationships are more present is this same subset. Tinder being a hookup application, it is intuitive to find more types of relationship which can be compared as flings and one-night stands (hookups for single persons open couples).\n\n```{r relationship-age, fig.cap=\"The type of relationships per age of participants, by Tinder Users and Non Users\", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}\nset.seed(1234)\ndfUser <- df_full %>% filter(Group == c(\"User\", \"TUser\")) %>%group_by(TinderMainScore)\n\nplot1<- df %>% filter(Group == \"User\" | Group == \"TUser\") %>%\n  group_by(Age, Relationship, Group) %>% \n  ggplot(aes( x = Age, Relationship)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size =10)) +\n   labs(\n     title = \"Type of relationship per age among Tinder Users subset\",\n     subtitle = \"Aging seems to be related to a higher number of possible relationship options\",\n     y=\"Types of relationship\"\n     )\n\n plot2 <- df %>% filter(Group == \"NonUser\" | Group == \"TNonUser\") %>%\n  group_by(Age, Relationship, Group) %>% \n  ggplot(aes( x = Age, Relationship)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = \"red\")) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size =10)) +\n   labs(\n     title = \"Type of relationship per age among Non Users subset\",\n     subtitle = \"Hookups as well as open relationships are less frequent\",\n     y=\"Types of relationship\"\n     )\n \ngridExtra::grid.arrange(plot1,plot2)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Self-Esteem Scale Body Acceptance and Impulsiveness Scales\n\n\nWe compute now the scores for self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness. Self-esteem score ranges between 0 and 30 (below 15 is a low self-esteem, 15-25 are considered as normal scores, above is high self-esteem), the body acceptance scale ranges between 0 and 52 and the impulsiveness scale from 0 to 9. A nice visual representation of the scores is done via scatter plots, as in figure \\@ref(fig:boxplots-per-score). \n\nSelf-esteem is lower for the Tinder User experimental group. The 1st decile of this group attaining the score of 9 out of 30, which is very low. The other groups have a lower variation between their 1st and 3rd mode and are above the threshold of 15, which lower bound of a self-esteem considered as normal.\nConcerning the score of body acceptance, they do not differ greatly between Tinder Users and Non-Users, but rather between control and experimental groups. Is means that the body acceptance scale here might be a low discriminatory feature to distinguish the profile of the non-users from users of the hookup application. Yet it means as well that in both cases, the treatment anchored well participants which have affected their perception of their body. The magnitude of the impact of the anchor might be of interest for the modelling part. Finally, The impulsiveness score is quite similar among any kind of group. In facts, we do not manipulated this feature in the experimental design and what we see is the natural leve of impulsiveness of the 124 participants. The score computed for Non-Users' experimental group is slightly higher than the other groups, whose median is significantly above 7, whereas the other medians are equal or below a score of 7 out of 10. \n\n\n```{r boxplots-per-score,fig.cap=\"Boxplots of the self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness per group\", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nset.seed(1234)\n\npl1 <- df_full %>% group_by(Group) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=SESscore,y=Group, color=Group ))+\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs (\n    subtitle = \"Non-Users have higher self-esteem scores, whereas \\nTinder Users experimental group has a significant lower score\",\n    x= \"SES score\", \n    y= \"Group of Users\"\n    ) \n\npl2 <-df_full %>% group_by(Group) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=BASscore,y=Group, color=Group ))+\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs (\n    subtitle = \"Body acceptance scores are somehow similar between Tinder Users and non Users, \\nthe variation of the score due to the treatments varies among group.\",\n    x= \"AIS score\",\n    y= \"Group of Users\"\n    )\npl3 <- df_full %>% group_by(Group) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=AISscore,y=Group, color=Group ))+\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs (\n    subtitle = \"Slightly divergent score for the experimental group of Tinder Users\",\n    x= \"AIS score\",\n    y= \"Group of Users\"\n    )\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(pl1, pl2, pl3)\n```\n\n\nThe table \\@ref(tab:scores) summarizes the scales scores for each subgroup, the control groups on the left hand side and the participants who received the manipulatation treatment on the right hand side. \n\nThe score for both control groups have higher scores for manipulated measures: self-esteem and body acceptance. The Non-Users control group has an average of 16.8 in self-esteem score, slightly higher than the Tinder users' one : 16.1 (+4.3%). Remind that we expected a higher results for non-users. The self-esteem score drops by 2.4% when the non-users experimental group receives negative feedbacks during the survey completion, and by 11.2 % when the feedbacks are sent to Tinder users. The variation in self-esteem score after treatment is greater for Tinder users, what might partially confirm our second hypothesis.\n\nThe body acceptance scores are again higher for control groups: Tinder users average score is 28.1 and Non-Users 28.0. Those scores drops by respectively 10.3% and 13.9% after treatments. Here, the score variation is greater for Non-Users, which infirms our second hypothesis. In addition, there is almost no difference in scores for both control group, infringing our first assumption.\n\nImpulsivity is not manipulated during this experience, it has been proved as a consistent feature for describing Tinder users, it serves here only for modeling matters. However, it is interesting to observe that the most \"impulsive\" participants belongs to Non-Users groups, in spite of the shortest survey they did: they filles in fiacts only three pages whereas Tinder users answered the additional and hidden Tinder Motive Scale.\n\n\n```{r scores, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nset.seed(1234)\nses_score <- df %>% \n  mutate(N = n()) %>%\n  summarize(SelfEsteemScore = sum(SESscore)/N) %>% unique() \n \nbas_score <- df %>% \n  mutate(N = n()) %>%\n  summarize(BASScore = sum(BASscore)/N) %>% unique() \n\nais_score <- df %>% \n  mutate(N = n()) %>%\n  summarize(AISScore= sum(AISscore)/N) %>% unique()\n\nscores <- left_join(ses_score,bas_score)\nscores <- left_join(scores, ais_score)\nscores <- scores[c(1, 2, 4, 3),]\nscores %>% t() %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()\n\n```\n\nKnowing that Tinder Users have different motives to join the well-known hookup application, it is pertinent to have a closer look on the self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness scores of the participants grouped by their main motives. As previously noted, information seeking is the most present motive in our sample and the Tinder USers having this main motives have lower scores: 15 in self-esteem and  25.5 for body acceptance. For the second and thirs main motive, respectively social pressure and social approval, the scores are by at minimum 5.22%. The  high body acceptance score for Tinder Users motived by social approval might be linked to the existing positive correlation between high body acceptance and social approval, the causation effect being hard to undercover (Mu and Wu, 2020). \n\n\n\n```{r scores-per-main-motive, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nset.seed(1234)\ndfUser <- df_full %>% filter(Group == c(\"User\", \"TUser\")) %>%group_by(TinderMainScore)\n\nses_scoreU <- dfUser %>% \n  mutate(N = n()) %>%\n  summarize(SelfEsteemScore = sum(SESscore)/N) %>% unique() \n \nbas_scoreU <- dfUser %>% \n  mutate(N = n()) %>%\n  summarize(BASScore = sum(BASscore)/N) %>% unique() \n\nais_scoreU <- dfUser %>% \n  mutate(N = n()) %>%\n  summarize(AISScore= sum(AISscore)/N) %>% unique()\n\nscoresU <- left_join(ses_scoreU,bas_scoreU)\nscoresU <- left_join(scoresU, ais_scoreU)\nscoresU <- scoresU[c(1, 5, 4, 2, 3), ]\nscoresU %>% t() %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Analysis of the scores\n## Significance of self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness\n\nThe present experiment aims to shows if there are significant differences in scores among groups in order to better profile Tinders users. The analysis of the significance of he scores are done with various linear regressions so as to know if the coefficient of those scores are enough discriminatory or not. First, the analysis is run on the scores only: self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness scores are the dependant variables, defining with only one independant variable: the category of participants, namely Users (CG), Treated Users, Non Users (CG) and Treated Non Users. Here, we are only interested by the coefficient and their p-values, not by the representativeness of the model (R-squared), since the computed scores reduce information, in addition to the fact that a model basedon a sole independant variable would hardly achieve satisfactory results for explaining an outcome. \n\nFor modeling matters, the levels of \"Groups\" were turned into integers so as to handle numerical results : \n\n  * NonUser : 1\n  * TNonUser: 2\n  * User:     3\n  * TUser :   4\n  \n### Self-Esteem\n  \n\\@ref(tab:significance-self-esteem-combined) The self-esteem scores are not statistically different for the control and experimental groups of non-users of the Tinder application. However, the self-esteem score of the Tinder Users is statistically different at 10%  from the Non-Users whereas Treated Users, our experimental group for Tinder users, is statistically different at 1%. They are satisfactory results, since we might have expected a slight difference between the control group and the experimental group of the subset of Non-Users, but a larger on between Tinder Users and Non Users (our first assumption).\n\n $$ Group = SESscore  + e$$\n\n```{r significance-self-esteem-combined, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndf_full$Group <- recode_factor(df_full$Group, \n                               NonUser = 1,\n                               TNonUser = 2,\n                               User = 3,\n                               TUser = 4)\n                                \nTNonUser <- df_full %>% filter(Group == \"2\")\nNonUser <- df_full %>% filter(Group == \"1\")\nTUser <- df_full %>% filter(Group == \"4\")\nUser <- df_full %>% filter(Group == \"3\")\n\nTinderUsers <- rbind2(TUser,User, deparse.level = 0)\n\n\nmymodUserSES <- lm(SESscore ~ Group, data = df_full)\n\nbroom::tidy(mymodUserSES) %>% \n  mutate(p.value = paste(round(p.value, 4), pval_star(p.value))) %>%\n  select(-statistic) %>%\n  kable( \n  caption = \"Significance of the self-esteem score\", digits = 2\n  ) %>% \n  kable_styling(\n  bootstrap_options = \"striped\"\n  )\n```\n\n### Body Acceptance Scale\n\n\\@ref(tab:significance-bodyacceptance-combined) However, the body acceptance score is more mitigated. In facts, this score is not statistically differents between both control groups. It signifies that the body acceptance is quite similar among the participants of the experiments, whether they use the application or not. It does not converge to the results on previous researches, such as Hawi and Samaha, in 2016.\nOur reference level being again the Non Users control group, the statistical differences are related to the experimental groups: the less different being the Non User experimental group at 10%, and the Tinder User experimental group at 1%. The key learning point here is that the variation resulting from the treatments achieve greater changes among Tinder Users than Non-Users. It is consistent with our second hypothesis, the potential unconstant self-image of the application users, since it was assumed they have a lower self-esteem and thus a potential greater propension to be affected by external manipulations. \n\n $$ Group = BASscore + e$$\n\n```{r significance-bodyacceptance-combined, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\nmymodUserBAS <- lm(BASscore ~ Group, data = df_full)\n\nbroom::tidy(mymodUserBAS) %>% \n  mutate(p.value = paste(round(p.value, 4), pval_star(p.value))) %>%\n  select(-statistic) %>%\n  kable( \n  caption = \"Significance of the body acceptance score\", digits = 2\n  ) %>% \n  kable_styling(\n  bootstrap_options = \"striped\"\n  )\n\n```\n\n### Impulsiveness Scale \n\n\\@ref(tab:significance-impulsiveness-combined) Finally, as previously said, impulsiveness was not manipulated during the experiment. The natural score per group of participants are not enough discriminatory to be relevant: no p-values admit a significance equal or higher than 10%. Being a Tinder User would reduce the the impulsiveness score slightly, but it is not statistically significant.\n\n $$ Group =  AISscore + e$$\n```{r significance-impulsiveness-combined, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nmymodUserAIS <- lm(AISscore ~ Group, data = df_full)\nbroom::tidy(mymodUserAIS) %>% \n  mutate(p.value = paste(round(p.value, 4), pval_star(p.value))) %>%\n  select(-statistic) %>%\n  kable( \n  caption = \"Significance of the body impulsiveness score\", digits = 2\n  ) %>% \n  kable_styling(\n  bootstrap_options = \"striped\"\n  )\n\n```\n\n\n## Modeling with SES, BAS and AIS scores\n\n### Exploring the significance of the scores among control and experimental groups\n\nAfter having analysed the features independently, we now constuct the model with the computed scores of self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness, the TinderMainScore being added for Tinder Users, in order to see if the regression is able to distinguish the experimental groups form the control ones. The model we analyse under this section if the following:\n \n $$ Group = SESscore + BASscore +AISscore + TinderMainScore + e$$\n \nWe first start with the Tinder Users subset. The level of our independant variable is:\n* 3 : Control group of Tinder users and \n* 4 : Experimental group of Tinder Users\n\nAfter running several regressions, the AIC-based selection model determined an inverse gaussian model to be the more fittable (AIC_inverse.gaussian : 75.79, AIC_Gamma : 76.79, AIC_gaussian : 80.04, AIC_Poisson : 231.9). However, the model is of a low quality: the Adjusted R-squared equals `r rsq`. The below plot points out a tendancy to overestimate the control group, since only 4 values are above the threshold of 3.5 (closer to 3 or 4?). The proportion of 3 and 4 in real values are not represented at all by the predictions.\n\n\n```{r model-Users, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nTinderUsers <- TinderUsers %>% filter(TinderMainScore != \"SocializingScore\")\nTinderUsers$Group <- as.numeric(as.character(TinderUsers$Group)) \n\nmymod <- glm(Group ~ SESscore + BASscore + AISscore + TinderMainScore, family = \"gaussian\", data = TinderUsers)\npred.te <-  predict(mymod, TinderUsers)\n\nplot(TinderUsers$Group, pred.te, main = \"Plot of the predictions against the real Tinder User Groups\", sub = \"Not very convincing...\", ylab = \"Predictions\", xlab = \"Real groups: 3 = CG and 4 = EG\")\ndd<-summary.lm(mymod)\nrsq <- dd$adj.r.squared\n```\n\nThe table \\@ref(tab:kable-TUsers) displays the coefficients and their significance. Self-esteem and body acceptance scores are significant at 1%, whereas Sexual exploration and social approval scores are significant at 5%. 4 features are significant at at least 5% for determining if the Tinder User belongs to the experimental group or the control group. It signifies that the gaussian model supports that the manipulations of the present experiments were enough effective to modify the scores. To summarize, some coefficients might be of interest while being in a model not satisfying.\n\n```{r kable-TUsers, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nbroom::tidy(mymod) %>% \n  mutate(p.value = paste(round(p.value, 4), pval_star(p.value))) %>%\n  select(-statistic) %>%\n  kable( \n  caption = \"Significance of the modelisation for Tinder Users\", digits = 2\n  ) %>% \n  kable_styling(\n  bootstrap_options = \"striped\"\n  )\n\n```\n\nTo better see how to improve our current model by keeping only the \"good\" coefficients, we use the step() function which compute the AIC for the model formed by adding (or removing) step by step the features of our previous model. The results of the the backward and forward methods are below. The results are read as the deviance (error) has to be the lowest and the AIC as well, which is our model selection criteria. Thus, the best model would be composed all the features except the AIS score. This information does not support our second starting hypothesis.\n\n```{r step TU, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\nbb <- step(mymod,\n     direction = c(\"both\"))\n\n```\n\nWe now reproduce our model to be applied to the Non-Users subset. The levels of our dependant variables are:\n* 1 : Control group of Non Users and \n* 2 : Experimental group of Non Users\n\nThe below plot presents as well bad results: we observe that the eight Non users being in the experimental group  do not have their equivalent in predictions, since ranging from `r min` and `r max`, which are far from the value 2. The Adjusted R-squared equals `r rsq2`, far as well from the threshold of 80% determining a somehow satisfactory model.\n\n```{r model-TNUsers, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\nTinderNonUsers <- rbind2(TNonUser,NonUser, deparse.level = 0)\nTinderNonUsers$Group <- as.numeric(as.character(TinderNonUsers$Group))\n\nmymod2 <- glm(Group ~ SESscore + BASscore + AISscore, family = \"Gamma\", data = TinderNonUsers)\npred.te2 <-  predict(mymod2, TinderNonUsers)\nmin<- min(pred.te2)\nmax<- max(pred.te2)\nplot(TinderNonUsers$Group, pred.te2, main = \"Plot of the predictions against the real Non User Groups\", sub = \"Not very convincing neither...!\", ylab = \"Predictions\", xlab = \"Real groups: 1 = CG and 2 = EG\")\ndd2<-summary.lm(mymod)\nrsq2 <- dd$adj.r.squared\n```\n\nThe table \\@ref(tab:kable-TNUsers) confirms our negative intuition: none of the values are significant, the model does not fit our data, what the Adjusted R-Squared already revealed. The positive correlation of the features would signify that higher are the scores, higher is the chance to belongs to the experimental group. In other words, the experimental should have higher scores than participants not treated, what is not consistent with the Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n```{r kable-TNUsers, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nbroom::tidy(mymod2) %>% \n  mutate(p.value = paste(round(p.value, 4), pval_star(p.value))) %>%\n  select(-statistic) %>%\n  kable( \n  caption = \"Significance of the coefficients for Non Users model\", digits = 2\n  ) %>% \n  kable_styling(\n  bootstrap_options = \"striped\"\n  )\n\nSESscore <- as.factor(df_full$SESscore)\nAISscore <- as.factor(df_full$AISscore)\nBASscore <- as.factor(df_full$BASscore)\nGroup <- as.factor(df_full$Group)\nRelationship <- as.factor(df_full$Relationship)\nAge <- as.factor(df_full$Age)\n\n```\n\n### Classification model for predicting the sample subsets\n\nIn addition to quantify the link between our inputs and output, we want to perhaps undercover a qualitative link: the use of a learner. A neural network with two nodes are used to classify our participants, we neglect here the parametrization of decay. The figure \\@ref(fig:neural-network1) depicts the computed neural network with the coefficients. Don't linger over the significance of the coefficients (which would be by the way a harsh tasks since neural network coefficients have a low interpretanility), the use of neural network here is only to verify the accuracy before to having a closer look, if and only if the model is satisfying. The accuracy of our neural network is `r acc1`, very low again and not satisfying. \n\n```{r neural-network1,fig.cap=\"Neural network based on the self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness scores\", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\nlibrary(nnet)\nSESscore <- as.factor(df_full$SESscore) # make our features as factors\nAISscore <- as.factor(df_full$AISscore)\nBASscore <- as.factor(df_full$BASscore)\nGroup <- as.factor(df_full$Group)\n\nnn1 <- nnet(Group ~ SESscore + BASscore + AISscore, size=2)\n\npred1 <- predict(nn1, type=\"class\")\ntab1 <- table(Obs=df_full$Group, Pred=pred1)\nacc1 <- sum(diag(tab1))/sum(tab1)\nlibrary(neuralnet)\nfnn1 <- as.formula(paste(\"Group ~ SESscore + BASscore + AISscore\", collapse = \" + \"))\nnn11 <- neuralnet(fnn1, data= df_full, hidden=2)\nplot(nn11, rep=\"best\", main = \" First version of a neural network to predict the sample subset\", sub= \" Group = SESscore + BASscore +AISscore + e\")\n\n```\n\nSince the above results are again not a help, we decided to included two additional features which might bring useful information to better model the data. In the Exploratory Data Analysis, we observed that the relationship type admits differences among groups, as well as the variable Age. Since it might be colinearity between both, we might select one rather the other. Because Age is more reliable and less subject to subjective interpretation, we built our regression as follows:\n\n$$ Group = SESscore + BASscore +AISscore + Age + e$$\nand the plot is shown below. The accuracy is far more satisfying: we reach `r acc2`! It is certainly too high this time not to include any bias. To investigate further, we would run a regression including both Age and Relationship and adding TinderMainScore, before using the step method in order to see if a better model could be built and reduce the bias.\n\n```{r neural-network2,fig.cap=\"Neural network based on the self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness scores\", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\ndf_full$Relationship <- recode_factor(df_full$Relationship, \n                               None = 1,\n                               PunctSex = 2,\n                               OpenRel = 3,\n                               CloseRel = 4)\nRelationship <- as.factor(df_full$Relationship)\n\nnn2 <- nnet(Group ~ SESscore + BASscore + AISscore + Age, size=2)\n\npred2 <- predict(nn2, type=\"class\")\n\ntab2 <- table(Obs=df_full$Group, Pred=pred2)\n\nacc2 <- sum(diag(tab2))/sum(tab2)\n\nlibrary(neuralnet)\nfnn2 <- as.formula(paste(\"Group ~ SESscore + BASscore + AISscore + Age\", collapse = \" + \"))\nnn22 <- neuralnet(fnn2, data= df_full, hidden=2)\nplot(nn22, rep=\"best\")\n\n```\n\n\n\n```{r model-tent, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\ndf_full <- df_full %>% filter(TinderMainScore != \"Socializing\")\ndf_full$Group <- as.numeric(as.character(df_full$Group))\n\nno.na.data <- na.omit(df_full)\nmymod3 <- glm(Group ~ SESscore + BASscore + AISscore + Age + Relationship + TinderMainScore, family = \"gaussian\", data = no.na.data)\n\ndd3<-summary.lm(mymod3)\nrsq3 <- dd3$adj.r.squared\n\nbroom::tidy(mymod3) %>% \n  mutate(p.value = paste(round(p.value, 4), pval_star(p.value))) %>%\n  select(-statistic) %>%\n  kable( \n  caption = \"Significance of the modelisation for Tinder Users\", digits = 2\n  ) %>% \n  kable_styling(\n  bootstrap_options = \"striped\"\n  )\n\n```\n\nSelf-esteem, body acceptance and Sexual experience as Tinder Motive are three significant features at 5%.  The Adjusted R-Squared equals `r rsq3`. In spite of a satisfactory AIC (56.1), The regression has no power for explaining the variance. The table \\@ref(tab:model-tent) underlines again the significance of the self-esteem score, but the other features do not have any statistical significance to model the group of participants. This deceiving attempt points out the bias shown in the previous neural network (the very high accuracy), and on the second hand the low quality of our data to satisfy our aim to model Tinder Users participants by their self-esteem, body acceptance AND impulsiveness scores, if not some other features to strenghten modeling ability. We might question the data collection process, the sampling methodology and the experimental design.\n\nThe step method proposes an improvement. Age and impulsiveness are not selected. The better model has a lower AIC (52.1):\n $$Group =  SESscore + BASscore + Relationship + TinderMainScore + e$$\n```{r model-tent2, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n\ndd <- step(mymod3,\n     direction = c(\"both\"))\n\n```\n\nThe regression is not satisfactory. The table \\@ref(tab:model-tent) underlines again the significance of the self-esteem score, but the other features do not have any statistical significance to model the group of participants. The Adjusted R-Squared equals `r rsq3`. This deceiving attempt points out the bias shown in the previous neural network (the very high accuracy), and on the second hand the low quality of our data to satisfy our aim to to have a well-built moodel for Tinder Users participants based on their self-esteem, body acceptance AND impulsiveness scores, if not some other features to strenghten modeling ability. We might question the sampling methodology and the experimental design.\n\n\n",
