<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Tinder Motive Scale</h2>
<p>We used the Tinder Motive Scale to better know the motives of the Tinder users of our sample. There are eight motives, which are * socializing * social pressure * social approval * entertainment * passing time * relationship seeking * information seeking and * sexual experience.</p>
<p>After computing the scores for each of them, we selected the highest score to determine the main motive of the Tinder User subset, displayed by figure <a href="exploratory-data-analysis.html#fig:tinder-main-motives">5.1</a>. Information seeking appears to be the strongest motivation (23 participants), followed by social pressure (16) and social approval, the main drive for 11 subjects. The results of Tinder motives scale might differ per country: there are different uses across countries of hookup applications, or more generally social networks (D' Silva &amp; Atay, 2019). For example, our results are different from the results of Barrada and Castro (2020), run on a almost similar sample in Spain (18-26 young adults). Their 1261 university students ranked first pass time, entertainment and information seeking (curiosity).</p>

<p>To refine this information, we decant by age of Tinder Users. The three main drives previously observed are quite homogeneously distributed by age group (information seeking in red, social approval in blue and social pressure in purple in the figure <a href="exploratory-data-analysis.html#fig:age-main-motive">5.2</a> ). Relationship seeking seems to be a drive for younger Users in the present sample. As supposed in some online articles, the pressure of having his first relationship is strong and push young persons to adopt behaviors in order to align themselves to their peers: finding a boy/girlfriend (Francis, 2019). It is an potential hypothesis underlying this fact: we could add other non-explored here hypothesis, such as being more naive or sentimental around 20 years old. Some normative studies concerning the utility of having a relationship during Universitarian cursus (Cheung, Lai and Wu, 2015) could be mentioned for another hypothesis: having a preferences to less commiting relationships during University.</p>

<p>Differences exists in types of relationship among Tinder Users and Non Users. Let's define what signify open relationship and punctual sex. According to the dictionnary, open relationship is defined by one where an established couple has mutually agreed to share a non-monogamous lifestyle. This includes either or both parties having other sexual and/or romantic partners (open relationship | Dictionary.com, 2020). Hookups, here named &quot;punctual sex&quot;, are defined by any form of intamicy with a member of the prefered sex who is not considered as a significant other (Urban Dictionary: hookup, 2020). As presented by the fingure <a href="exploratory-data-analysis.html#fig:relationship-age">5.3</a>, punctual sexual relations is correlated with Tinder uses, as this form of relationship is the second most represented type in the respective subset per age. In addition, open relationships are more present is this same subset. Tinder being a hookup application, it is intuitive to find more types of relationship which can be compared as flings and one-night stands (hookups for single persons open couples).</p>

<div id="self-esteem-scale-body-acceptance-and-impulsiveness-scales" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Self-Esteem Scale Body Acceptance and Impulsiveness Scales</h2>
<p>We compute now the scores for self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness. Self-esteem score ranges between 0 and 30 (below 15 is a low self-esteem, 15-25 are considered as normal scores, above is high self-esteem), the body acceptance scale ranges between 0 and 52 and the impulsiveness scale from 0 to 9. A nice visual representation of the scores is done via scatter plots, as in figure <a href="exploratory-data-analysis.html#fig:boxplots-per-score">5.4</a>.</p>
<p>Self-esteem is lower for the Tinder User experimental group. The 1st decile of this group attaining the score of 9 out of 30, which is very low. The other groups have a lower variation between their 1st and 3rd mode and are above the threshold of 15, which lower bound of a self-esteem considered as normal. Concerning the score of body acceptance, they do not differ greatly between Tinder Users and Non-Users, but rather between control and experimental groups. Is means that the body acceptance scale here might be a low discriminatory feature to distinguish the profile of the non-users from users of the hookup application. Yet it means as well that in both cases, the treatment anchored well participants which have affected their perception of their body. The magnitude of the impact of the anchor might be of interest for the modelling part. Finally, The impulsiveness score is quite similar among any kind of group. In facts, we do not manipulated this feature in the experimental design and what we see is the natural leve of impulsiveness of the 124 participants. The score computed for Non-Users' experimental group is slightly higher than the other groups, whose median is significantly above 7, whereas the other medians are equal or below a score of 7 out of 10.</p>

<p>The table <a href="#tab:scores"><strong>??</strong></a> summarizes the scales scores for each subgroup, the control groups on the left hand side and the participants who received the manipulatation treatment on the right hand side.</p>
<p>The score for both control groups have higher scores for manipulated measures: self-esteem and body acceptance. The Non-Users control group has an average of 16.8 in self-esteem score, slightly higher than the Tinder users' one : 16.1 (+4.3%). Remind that we expected a higher results for non-users. The self-esteem score drops by 2.4% when the non-users experimental group receives negative feedbacks during the survey completion, and by 11.2 % when the feedbacks are sent to Tinder users. The variation in self-esteem score after treatment is greater for Tinder users, what might partially confirm our second hypothesis.</p>
<p>The body acceptance scores are again higher for control groups: Tinder users average score is 28.1 and Non-Users 28.0. Those scores drops by respectively 10.3% and 13.9% after treatments. Here, the score variation is greater for Non-Users, which infirms our second hypothesis. In addition, there is almost no difference in scores for both control group, infringing our first assumption.</p>
<p>Impulsivity is not manipulated during this experience, it has been proved as a consistent feature for describing Tinder users, it serves here only for modeling matters. However, it is interesting to observe that the most &quot;impulsive&quot; participants belongs to Non-Users groups, in spite of the shortest survey they did: they filles in fiacts only three pages whereas Tinder users answered the additional and hidden Tinder Motive Scale.</p>

<p>Knowing that Tinder Users have different motives to join the well-known hookup application, it is pertinent to have a closer look on the self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness scores of the participants grouped by their main motives. As previously noted, information seeking is the most present motive in our sample and the Tinder USers having this main motives have lower scores: 15 in self-esteem and 25.5 for body acceptance. For the second and thirs main motive, respectively social pressure and social approval, the scores are by at minimum 5.22%. The high body acceptance score for Tinder Users motived by social approval might be linked to the existing positive correlation between high body acceptance and social approval, the causation effect being hard to undercover (Mu and Wu, 2020).</p>
