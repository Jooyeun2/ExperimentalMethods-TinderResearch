The true experimental methods were designed to impact self-esteem and body acceptance, so as to evaluate the scores among control groups and the degree of magnitude of the varaition in self-esteem and body acceptance in the experimental groups. The aim of this study is to obtain consistent results with previous research and to demonstrate that the self-esteem and body acceptance of Tinder Users, assumed to be lower, is as well less robust than Non-Users' ones. The experience was an online survey-based questionnaire inluding the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, Body Acceptance Scale and the Abbreviated Impulsiveness Scale and a hidden page for Tinder Users: the Tinder Motive Scale. Feedbacks were sent to experimental groups during the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and an anchoring article was displayed before the Body Acceptance Scale page in order both to lower the scores. The results points out that manipulations impacted experimental groups in different ways but significantly. The Modeling part confirms the significant difference in self-esteem and body acceptance scores among groups: those both scores are the most important features to model the sample.However, the models built, more precisely the neural networks, are not satisfactoriy enough to be used for categorizing participants. The experiment is partially satisfaying and improvements should be done on the experimental design. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction With 57 millions of Tinder users worldwide, the dating app Tinder had been a trend until becoming a robust daily service mostly used by young adults. An extensive scientific litterature investigate Tinder an its uses. Typical dating apps, and mostly Tinder, rely on objectification theory (Strubel and Petrie, 2017), which supports that Tinder represents a contemporary medium for appearance pressures and its use is associated with a variety of negative perceptions about body and self and with increases in individuals’ likelihood to internalize appearance ideals and make comparisons to others. Path analysis showed that self-esteem mediated the effect of social media addiction on satisfaction with life (Hawi and Samaha, 2016). Self-esteem is defined by a total of the individual's thoughts and feelings with reference to himself as an object (Rosenberg, 1965). Self-esteem enhancement motivation to use Tinder consistently showed an important role in the development and maintenance of problematic Tinder use compared to the effects of personality traits Personality has a minor role in behavioral addictions. However, self-determination theory-based need frustrations are more relevant background variables of problematic online behaviors (Orosz et al., 2018) Moreover, impulsive people may be drawn to dating apps due to the speed with which they can rate people. Impulsiveness has been linked to a variety of risky behaviors (Stanford, et al., 1996) and may be connected to both using the app extensively and quickly meeting people one meets on dating apps. The research conveys a lot of hypothesis and directions to take for further investigations. Conversations and animated debates are created by experiences via this application at the University of Lausanne and beyond, and Tinder announced during the second quarter that the pandemic has increased the number of active users. In troubled times as we have known in 2020, it is interesting to investigate the current use of Tinder among 18-26 years old young adults. This experiment is an investigation on self-perception of Tinder users, more precisely what their scores of body acceptance, self-esteem and impulsiveness are and what is the magnitude of change of those scores when we manipulate their self-perception. The measures of those traits are supported by the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (Winch and Rosenberg, 1965), the Body Acceptance Scale (Avalos, Tylka and Wood-Barcalow, 2005) and the Abbreviated Impulsiveness Scale (Coutlee, Politzer, Hoyle and Huettel, 2014), short surved-based tests in order to limit the overall experiment time. By doing this experiment, the present work aims to obtain cosistent results with respect to the underlying litterature, while better understand the user profiles of the sample and their self-esteem robustness to anegative manipulation. As start hypothesis, we consider here that the Tinder users' scores of self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsivity would be significantly different from non users. We expect to have lower scores in the two first measures and a higher impulsivitiy score. As we expect lower self-esteem score in the Tinder users subset, we as well expect a high variation of self-esteem when externally manipulated, what would reflect an inconstant image of himself weaken by a lower self-esteem. The survey-based control Group posttest-only designed experiment is run as follow: a participant is categorized as Tinder users or non User to answer the Tinder Motivation Scale, the Rosenberg S-ES, the BAS ans the AIS during a computer-based test. Non-Users would be the referential for the scores (control group). The Tinder Users would be randomly allocated to the treatments consisting in negative feedbacks sent during the Rosenberg's Scale and an anchoring negative article on self-body image and its cruciality in the pre-dating mindset. "],["research-question-definitions-and-hypothesis.html", "3 Research Question, Definitions and Hypothesis", " 3 Research Question, Definitions and Hypothesis The research question is how does self-esteem, body acceptance &amp; impulsiveness scores model the motive of Tinder use and what are their proprensities to vary? It is based on different studies showing that addictive use of social media had a negative association with self-esteem, and the latter had a positive association with satisfaction with life. (Hawi and Samaha, 2016) or that personality plays only a minor role in behavioral addictions. The problematic use of Tinder is not investigated here, but this experience is run in the context of a pandemic, whose consequences might have affected more certain persons who can rely on Tinder for a ego boost (Hawi and Samaha, 2016). This point is supported by studies supporting that self-determination theory-based need frustrations are more relevant background variables of problematic online behaviors such as problematic Tinder use (Orosz et al., 2018). The increasing use of Tinder, mentioned above, may meet needs other than pleasure and entertainment and may be motivated by a variety of social and psychological reasons. Self-esteem is one of the psychological reasons that may be related to the use of Tinder, which will meet a different need if self-esteem is high or low. Self-esteem is an individual's subjective assessment of his/her own worth. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself (for example, &quot;I am unloved&quot;, &quot;I am worthy&quot;) as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame. (Hewitt, John P., 2009) Also, since Tinder is based on a system of representation where the selection of users is based on photos (3 usually, max 9 photos and only 150 characters max for the descrption) and therefore on the physical, the perception of one's body is intrinsically correlated. This is why we decided to study the body acceptance. Body image had been defined by previous researches as a complex, multidimensional construct that includes self-perceptions and attitudes (i.e., thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with regard to the body (e.g., Cash, Jakatdar, &amp; Williams, 2004; Thompson, Heinberg, Altabe, &amp; Tantleff-Dunn, 1999).Different components composed body image such as (not exhaustive list) appearance evaluation, appearance orientation, body esteem, and accuracy of size perception (Thompson et al., 1999). Motivations for using Tinder based on a self-perception bias can also be related to impulsiveness, which is why impulsiveness is also studied here. Impulsiveness is a personality trait that reflects an urge to act spontaneously, without thinking or planning ahead for the consequences of your actions. High impulsiveness is characteristic of a variety of problematic behaviorsm implying for example danger seeking and high risk-taking (Coutlee, Politzer, Hoyle and Huettel, 2014). To study these three variables, we have chosen three scales of measurement: Tinder Motives Scale (TMS) (Timmermans and De Caluwé, 2017): According to this study, 8 motivations were defined to join Tinder. These reasons constitute the levels of our TinderMainMotives feature: social approval, social pressure, information seeking, relationship seeking, passing time, entertaining, sexual experience and socializing. This scale has been adopted by several other researchers, making it a legitimate choice. The questionnaires vary in length and questions, however they overlap in these 8 motivational categories. Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (SES) ( Winch and Rosenberg, 1965): Since 1965, this scale is the reference to define the self-esteem of a subject. Composed of 13 questions bringing between 0 and 3 points, the sum of the points of the questions allows the measurement of the self-esteem. A result lower than 15 marks a (very) low self-esteem, a score between 15 and 25 points out of 30 being regarded as normal. Body Acceptance scale (BAS) (Avalos, Tylka and Wood-Barcalow, 2005): The choice of the BAS was made after reading a study on the robustness of this scale among the multitude of other measures of the body aceptance scale. The questionnaire has 13 positive questions allowing the calculation of an average score between 1 (non-acceptance) and 4 (good body acceptance). Impulsiveness scale (AIS) (Coutlee, Politzer, Hoyle and Huettel, 2014) : Il s'agit d'un questionnaire de 12 questions qui calculent le score de 3 dimensions, Attention, Motor and Future Planning. The initial scale being of a certain length, an abbreviated version was created and Coutlee, Politzer, Hoyle and Huettel assessed in 2014 the sustainable results obtained by this shortest scale. We use here the abbreviated version, in order to keep somehow a similar length among the scales. Our start hypothesis are the following: Non-tinder subset have different scores in BAS, S-ES and AIS Significant correlation between Tinder Motive Scales and BAS, S-ES and AIS, and can be used as significant feature for modeling Self-esteem and body acceptance can be manipulated since already low "],["experimental-method-and-sampling.html", "4 Experimental method and sampling 4.1 Experimental design 4.2 Sample", " 4 Experimental method and sampling 4.1 Experimental design The present survey-based experiment is created on the Questback platform (licensed), which is an advanced tool for professional surveys as much as academical computer-based experiments. A license was bought. Five pages or questions are displayed: a first page for socio-demographic data collection, after comes the Tinder Motive Scale (TMS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (S-ES), the Body Acceptance Scale (BAS) and the Abbreviated Impulsiviness Scale (AIS). The experiment is run with two control groups* and two experimental groups to have observation on both Tinder Users and Non-Users. Tinder users, which are catergorized as such if they have a Tinder account and use it more than once a month. Non-Users have thus either a non-active account or no account at all. Both Users and Non-Users particpants are randomly allocated to the treatment. It consists in negative feedback during the completion of the S-ES and an negative anchor before the BAS. Negative feedbacks are articifical comparisons with the other participants, aiming to informs on the lower quality performance of the manipulated participant so as to perturbate him. The S-ES are expected to be affected by the treatment, whose measure would outline a greater variation in score than for the control group. For the second treatment, the article on body acceptance, conveys judgements on aesthetics, corpulence, beauty and flaws. Both treatments are based on usual experimental manipulations. Nevertheless, the effects of manipulation by bogus feedbacks is disputed, but it is enough used that to remain an easy option for manipulating self-esteem. For body acceptance score, we use an anchor with the article. The data collected would help to verify the 1rst hypothesis: a significant difference in scores, and to compare the variation of those scores after treatments. The initial experimental design was adapted as soon as December 18th to find Non-Users so as to participate to the treatment, in order to have a comparison point for the score variation. 4.2 Sample The sample was gathered by a non-probabilistic process. The advertisement of the survey consists in Facebook posts and to personnal invitation on Whatsapp (friends and acquaintances). Participants relayed the link to the survey, and without knowing until what extent it has worked, we prefer here to speak about convenience sampling rather than snowball sampling. Initially composed by 131 participants, after cleaning to remove participants not in the target age (18-26), the resulting sample counts 124 subjects, distributed as the ?? shows. Group n NonUser 48 TNonUser 8 TUser 28 User 40 To better see the distribution of the age, we use the 4.1 figure. The age is less well distributed for the experimental group of Non-Users, as it might be expected since this group was created at a late stage of the experiment. It is less representative of the main sample, if we consider the the Non-Users control group as a realistic caption of the population of Tinder Non-Users. ## `summarise()` regrouping output by &#39;Age&#39; (override with `.groups` argument) Figure 4.1: Age per group plot Our panel is not homogeneously composed by students, but as well by part-timers, fixed employees and three job-seekers ( ?? ). ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) SocialStatus n Employed 17 EmployesStudent 39 Student 65 Unemployed 3 Our sample is composed by 70 single participants and 54 participants in a relationship (43.5%). As present plot 4.2 plot, Non-Users are essentially composed by participants engaged in a relationship or single. We note that they are more inclined to have a traditionnal approach to relationship (binary options): either being in a relatioship where having extra sexual relationships is forbidden or being single. For Tinder Users, the relationship types are more diversified: there are almost twice more of open relationships than closed ones, 16 people have punctual sex/ hookup plans and a majority is single (32 people). Statistics on Tinder informs that the worldwide Tinder users population composed by 54% of single users and 46% in a relationship (Smith, 2020). Our subset is composed by 26.5% participants in a relationship and 73.5% are single. !! Be aware that the below figure present in an inverse order the control and experimental groups of Tinder Users, in comparison to the Non Users . ## `summarise()` regrouping output by &#39;Relationship&#39; (override with `.groups` argument) Figure 4.2: relationship-plot "],["exploratory-data-analysis.html", "5 Exploratory Data Analysis 5.1 Tinder Motive Scale 5.2 Self-Esteem Scale Body Acceptance and Impulsiveness Scales", " 5 Exploratory Data Analysis 5.1 Tinder Motive Scale We used the Tinder Motive Scale to better know the motives of the Tinder users of our sample. There are eight motives, which are * socializing * social pressure * social approval * entertainment * passing time * relationship seeking * information seeking and * sexual experience. After computing the scores for each of them, we selected the highest score to determine the main motive of the Tinder User subset, displayed by figure 5.1. Information seeking appears to be the strongest motivation (23 participants), followed by social pressure (16) and social approval, the main drive for 11 subjects. The results of Tinder motives scale might differ per country: there are different uses across countries of hookup applications, or more generally social networks (D' Silva &amp; Atay, 2019). For example, our results are different from the results of Barrada and Castro (2020), run on a almost similar sample in Spain (18-26 young adults). Their 1261 university students ranked first pass time, entertainment and information seeking (curiosity). ## Joining, by = c(&quot;lfdn&quot;, &quot;SocializingScore&quot;, &quot;SocPressureScore&quot;, &quot;SocApprovalScore&quot;, &quot;EntertainmentScore&quot;, &quot;PassTimeScore&quot;, &quot;RelSeekingScore&quot;, &quot;InfoSeekingScore&quot;, &quot;SexualExpScore&quot;) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) Figure 5.1: Tinder users' computed main motivations To refine this information, we decant by age of Tinder Users. The three main drives previously observed are quite homogeneously distributed by age group (information seeking in red, social approval in blue and social pressure in purple in the figure 5.2 ). Relationship seeking seems to be a drive for younger Users in the present sample. As supposed in some online articles, the pressure of having his first relationship is strong and push young persons to adopt behaviors in order to align themselves to their peers: finding a boy/girlfriend (Francis, 2019). It is an potential hypothesis underlying this fact: we could add other non-explored here hypothesis, such as being more naive or sentimental around 20 years old. Some normative studies concerning the utility of having a relationship during Universitarian cursus (Cheung, Lai and Wu, 2015) could be mentioned for another hypothesis: having a preferences to less commiting relationships during University. Figure 5.2: The motives per age of Tinder Users Differences exists in types of relationship among Tinder Users and Non Users. Let's define what signify open relationship and punctual sex. According to the dictionnary, open relationship is defined by one where an established couple has mutually agreed to share a non-monogamous lifestyle. This includes either or both parties having other sexual and/or romantic partners (open relationship | Dictionary.com, 2020). Hookups, here named &quot;punctual sex&quot;, are defined by any form of intamicy with a member of the prefered sex who is not considered as a significant other (Urban Dictionary: hookup, 2020). As presented by the fingure 5.3, punctual sexual relations is correlated with Tinder uses, as this form of relationship is the second most represented type in the respective subset per age. In addition, open relationships are more present is this same subset. Tinder being a hookup application, it is intuitive to find more types of relationship which can be compared as flings and one-night stands (hookups for single persons open couples). Figure 5.3: The type of relationships per age of participants, by Tinder Users and Non Users 5.2 Self-Esteem Scale Body Acceptance and Impulsiveness Scales We compute now the scores for self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness. Self-esteem score ranges between 0 and 30 (below 15 is a low self-esteem, 15-25 are considered as normal scores, above is high self-esteem), the body acceptance scale ranges between 0 and 52 and the impulsiveness scale from 0 to 9. A nice visual representation of the scores is done via scatter plots, as in figure 5.4. Self-esteem is lower for the Tinder User experimental group. The 1st decile of this group attaining the score of 9 out of 30, which is very low. The other groups have a lower variation between their 1st and 3rd mode and are above the threshold of 15, which lower bound of a self-esteem considered as normal. Concerning the score of body acceptance, they do not differ greatly between Tinder Users and Non-Users, but rather between control and experimental groups. Is means that the body acceptance scale here might be a low discriminatory feature to distinguish the profile of the non-users from users of the hookup application. Yet it means as well that in both cases, the treatment anchored well participants which have affected their perception of their body. The magnitude of the impact of the anchor might be of interest for the modelling part. Finally, The impulsiveness score is quite similar among any kind of group. In facts, we do not manipulated this feature in the experimental design and what we see is the natural leve of impulsiveness of the 124 participants. The score computed for Non-Users' experimental group is slightly higher than the other groups, whose median is significantly above 7, whereas the other medians are equal or below a score of 7 out of 10. Figure 5.4: Boxplots of the self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness per group The table ?? summarizes the scales scores for each subgroup, the control groups on the left hand side and the participants who received the manipulatation treatment on the right hand side. The score for both control groups have higher scores for manipulated measures: self-esteem and body acceptance. The Non-Users control group has an average of 16.8 in self-esteem score, slightly higher than the Tinder users' one : 16.1 (+4.3%). Remind that we expected a higher results for non-users. The self-esteem score drops by 2.4% when the non-users experimental group receives negative feedbacks during the survey completion, and by 11.2 % when the feedbacks are sent to Tinder users. The variation in self-esteem score after treatment is greater for Tinder users, what might partially confirm our second hypothesis. The body acceptance scores are again higher for control groups: Tinder users average score is 28.1 and Non-Users 28.0. Those scores drops by respectively 10.3% and 13.9% after treatments. Here, the score variation is greater for Non-Users, which infirms our second hypothesis. In addition, there is almost no difference in scores for both control group, infringing our first assumption. Impulsivity is not manipulated during this experience, it has been proved as a consistent feature for describing Tinder users, it serves here only for modeling matters. However, it is interesting to observe that the most &quot;impulsive&quot; participants belongs to Non-Users groups, in spite of the shortest survey they did: they filles in fiacts only three pages whereas Tinder users answered the additional and hidden Tinder Motive Scale.

As previously noted, information seeking is the most present motive in our sample and the Tinder USers having this main motives have lower scores: 15 in self-esteem and 25.5 for body acceptance. For the second and thirs main motive, respectively social pressure and social approval, the scores are by at minimum 5.22%. The high body acceptance score for Tinder Users motived by social approval might be linked to the existing positive correlation between high body acceptance and social approval, the causation effect being hard to undercover (Mu and Wu, 2020).

The analysis of the significance of he scores are done with various linear regressions so as to know if the coefficient of those scores are enough discriminatory or not. First, the analysis is run on the scores only: self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness scores are the dependant variables, defining with only one independant variable: the category of participants, namely Users (CG), Treated Users, Non Users (CG) and Treated Non Users. Here, we are only interested by the coefficient and their p-values, not by the representativeness of the model (R-squared), since the computed scores reduce information, in addition to the fact that a model basedon a sole independant variable would hardly achieve satisfactory results for explaining an outcome. For modeling matters, the levels of &quot;Groups&quot; were turned into integers so as to handle numerical results : NonUser : 1 TNonUser: 2 User: 3 TUser : 4 6.1.1 Self-Esteem 6.1 The self-esteem scores are not statistically different for the control and experimental groups of non-users of the Tinder application. However, the self-esteem score of the Tinder Users is statistically different at 10% from the Non-Users whereas Treated Users, our experimental group for Tinder users, is statistically different at 1%. They are satisfactory results, since we might have expected a slight difference between the control group and the experimental group of the subset of Non-Users, but a larger on between Tinder Users and Non Users (our first assumption). \\[ Group = SESscore + e\\] Table 6.1: Significance of the self-esteem score term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 16.81 0.26 0 *** Group2 -0.44 0.68 0.5234 Group3 -0.71 0.38 0.0654 Group4 -2.53 0.43 0 *** 6.1.2 Body Acceptance Scale 6.2 However, the body acceptance score is more mitigated. In facts, this score is not statistically differents between both control groups. It signifies that the body acceptance is quite similar among the participants of the experiments, whether they use the application or not. It does not converge to the results on previous researches, such as Hawi and Samaha, in 2016. Our reference level being again the Non Users control group, the statistical differences are related to the experimental groups: the less different being the Non User experimental group at 10%, and the Tinder User experimental group at 1%. The key learning point here is that the variation resulting from the treatments achieve greater changes among Tinder Users than Non-Users. It is consistent with our second hypothesis, the potential unconstant self-image of the application users, since it was assumed they have a lower self-esteem and thus a potential greater propension to be affected by external manipulations. \\[ Group = BASscore + e\\] Table 6.2: Significance of the body acceptance score term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 27.98 0.75 0 *** Group2 -3.85 1.98 0.0535 Group3 0.15 1.11 0.8955 Group4 -2.73 1.23 0.0284 * 6.1.3 Impulsiveness Scale 6.3 Finally, as previously said, impulsiveness was not manipulated during the experiment. The natural score per group of participants are not enough discriminatory to be relevant: no p-values admit a significance equal or higher than 10%. Being a Tinder User would reduce the the impulsiveness score slightly, but it is not statistically significant. \\[ Group = AISscore + e\\] Table 6.3: Significance of the body impulsiveness score term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 7.01 0.16 0 *** Group2 0.31 0.43 0.4764 Group3 -0.08 0.24 0.7332 Group4 -0.08 0.27 0.7606 6.2 Modeling with SES, BAS and AIS scores 6.2.1 Exploring the significance of the scores among control and experimental groups After having analysed the features independently, we now constuct the model with the computed scores of self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness, the TinderMainScore being added for Tinder Users, in order to see if the regression is able to distinguish the experimental groups form the control ones. The model we analyse under this section if the following: \\[ Group = SESscore + BASscore +AISscore + TinderMainScore + e\\] We first start with the Tinder Users subset. The level of our independant variable is: * 3 : Control group of Tinder users and * 4 : Experimental group of Tinder Users After running several regressions, the AIC-based selection model determined an inverse gaussian model to be the more fittable (AIC_inverse.gaussian : 75.79, AIC_Gamma : 76.79, AIC_gaussian : 80.04, AIC_Poisson : 231.9). However, the model is of a low quality: the Adjusted R-squared equals 0.332. The below plot points out a tendancy to overestimate the control group, since only 4 values are above the threshold of 3.5 (closer to 3 or 4?). The proportion of 3 and 4 in real values are not represented at all by the predictions. The table 6.4 displays the coefficients and their significance. Self-esteem and body acceptance scores are significant at 1%, whereas Sexual exploration and social approval scores are significant at 5%. 4 features are significant at at least 5% for determining if the Tinder User belongs to the experimental group or the control group. It signifies that the gaussian model supports that the manipulations of the present experiments were enough effective to modify the scores. To summarize, some coefficients might be of interest while being in a model not satisfying.

The results of the the backward and forward methods are below. The results are read as the deviance (error) has to be the lowest and the AIC as well, which is our model selection criteria. Thus, the best model would be composed all the features except the AIS score. This information does not support our second starting hypothesis. ## Start: AIC=78.2 ## Group ~ SESscore + BASscore + AISscore + TinderMainScore ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## - AISscore 1 9.66 76.4 ## &lt;none&gt; 9.63 78.2 ## - TinderMainScore 4 11.20 80.3 ## - BASscore 1 12.01 91.0 ## - SESscore 1 14.31 102.7 ## ## Step: AIC=76.4 ## Group ~ SESscore + BASscore + TinderMainScore ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## &lt;none&gt; 9.66 76.4 ## + AISscore 1 9.63 78.2 ## - TinderMainScore 4 11.20 78.3 ## - BASscore 1 12.10 89.5 ## - SESscore 1 14.31 100.7 We now reproduce our model to be applied to the Non-Users subset. The levels of our dependant variables are: * 1 : Control group of Non Users and * 2 : Experimental group of Non Users The below plot presents as well bad results: we observe that the eight Non users being in the experimental group do not have their equivalent in predictions, since ranging from 0.751 and 1.105, which are far from the value 2. The Adjusted R-squared equals 0.332, far as well from the threshold of 80% determining a somehow satisfactory model. The table 6.5 confirms our negative intuition: none of the values are significant, the model does not fit our data, what the Adjusted R-Squared already revealed. The positive correlation of the features would signify that higher are the scores, higher is the chance to belongs to the experimental group. In other words, the experimental should have higher scores than participants not treated, what is not consistent with the Exploratory Data Analysis.

A neural network with two nodes are used to classify our participants, we neglect here the parametrization of decay. The figure 6.1 depicts the computed neural network with the coefficients. Don't linger over the significance of the coefficients (which would be by the way a harsh tasks since neural network coefficients have a low interpretanility), the use of neural network here is only to verify the accuracy before to having a closer look, if and only if the model is satisfying. The accuracy of our neural network is 0.895, very low again and not satisfying. ## # weights: 172 ## initial value 164.894632 ## iter 10 value 115.033512 ## iter 20 value 53.546515 ## iter 30 value 36.927437 ## iter 40 value 30.813333 ## iter 50 value 29.864486 ## iter 60 value 29.637065 ## iter 70 value 29.501367 ## iter 80 value 29.448374 ## iter 90 value 29.409839 ## iter 100 value 29.365045 ## final value 29.365045 ## stopped after 100 iterations Figure 6.1: Neural network based on the self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness scores Since the above results are again not a help, we decided to included two additional features which might bring useful information to better model the data. In the Exploratory Data Analysis, we observed that the relationship type admits differences among groups, as well as the variable Age. Since it might be colinearity between both, we might select one rather the other. Because Age is more reliable and less subject to subjective interpretation, we built our regression as follows: \\[ Group = SESscore + BASscore +AISscore + Age + e\\] and the plot is shown below. The accuracy is far more satisfying: we reach 0.379! It is certainly too high this time not to include any bias. To investigate further, we would run a regression including both Age and Relationship and adding TinderMainScore, before using the step method in order to see if a better model could be built and reduce the bias. ## # weights: 188 ## initial value 168.698992 ## iter 10 value 106.539701 ## iter 20 value 52.650667 ## iter 30 value 45.704712 ## iter 40 value 41.847713 ## iter 50 value 41.267943 ## iter 60 value 40.996947 ## iter 70 value 40.925583 ## iter 80 value 40.903592 ## iter 90 value 40.879466 ## iter 100 value 40.870505 ## final value 40.870505 ## stopped after 100 iterations Figure 6.2: Neural network based on the self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness scores Table 6.6: Significance of the modelisation for Tinder Users term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 6.42 0.84 0 *** SESscore -0.15 0.03 0 *** BASscore -0.04 0.01 0.005 ** AISscore -0.01 0.05 0.9217 Age 0.00 0.03 0.9488 Relationship2 0.13 0.15 0.3786 TinderMainScoreRelSeekingScore 0.20 0.27 0.4698 TinderMainScoreSexualExpScore 0.40 0.20 0.0493 * TinderMainScoreSocApprovalScore 0.35 0.18 0.0589 TinderMainScoreSocPressureScore 0.10 0.15 0.5029 Self-esteem, body acceptance and Sexual experience as Tinder Motive are three significant features at 5%.

The table 6.6 underlines again the significance of the self-esteem score, but the other features do not have any statistical significance to model the group of participants. This deceiving attempt points out the bias shown in the previous neural network (the very high accuracy), and on the second hand the low quality of our data to satisfy our aim to model Tinder Users participants by their self-esteem, body acceptance AND impulsiveness scores, if not some other features to strenghten modeling ability. We might question the data collection process, the sampling methodology and the experimental design. The step method proposes an improvement. Age and impulsiveness are not selected.

The table 6.6 underlines again the significance of the self-esteem score, but the other features do not have any statistical significance to model the group of participants. The Adjusted R-Squared equals 0.337. This deceiving attempt points out the bias shown in the previous neural network (the very high accuracy), and on the second hand the low quality of our data to satisfy our aim to to have a well-built moodel for Tinder Users participants based on their self-esteem, body acceptance AND impulsiveness scores, if not some other features to strenghten modeling ability. We might question the sampling methodology and the experimental design. "],["limitations.html", "7 Limitations", " 7 Limitations This experiment has a certain number of limitations. Limitations of experiments occuring at manipulating values are multiple, especially when it comes to survey-based experiments. The main biases that researchers face are well known: biases in participant responses (response bias, order effects, boredom effect, etc.), in the design of the experiment (is this really the right way to test what we would like to test?), in sampling (problem of representativeness, which will limit generalization), in analysis (do we answer the research question in a comprehensive way and try to discover potential hidden trends). These problems encountered can be rectified in the course of experiments, but willanyhow necessarily affect the results. The following synoptic list points out some of the weaknesses of this experiment: Web-based Data Collection: Collecting data remotely without being able to meet the participants dematerializes the interest and seriousness of the experiment as much as the information given to the participants. There is a lack of control over the conditions under which the participants completed the questionnaire. Also the completion of online studies can be biased by the subjectivity of the participants, who will not want to answer the truth or will give their own truth. To reduce this risk in the Tinder Motive Scale, I presented the questionnaire clearly, with a positive and funny tone as suggested (XXXXXXXX Humor and Information Study), and closing with &quot;Don't be shy&quot;, to explicitly put my foot in it. However, it is impossible to quantify the effect of this kind of bias in such a small-scale study. Sampling methodology : The sample is non-probabilistic, which a suboptimal method already implies in order to constitute a representative panel of the population under study: young people aged 18-26. Sampling convenience has an excellent effort/recruitment ratio, the disadvantage being that it allows trends to be sketched without being able to make them generalizable. The experimental group for Non-Users was created lately and at this stage non-Tinder participants were systematically allocated to this group: the process was not randomized. Also, the proportion of control and experimental groups are not the same and we run the risk of obtaining results biased by extreme values not balanced by a sufficient sample size. Experimental design: Survey-based posttest-only design: This form is the simplest way to conduct an online experience and was well suited for the completion of different questionnaires to obtain self-esteem, body acceptance and impulsiveness scores. However, a pre-test post-test design would have avoided control groups and forgotten to create them for non-users. In this case, it would have been necessary to revise the form of the survey-based experiment in order to evaluate twice the scores obtained for these three variables. Manipulation: Bogus feedback is a method that is disputed in the experimental field. The effects are not proven. However, we were able to observe sufficient variation to suggest that this manipulation worked on our experimental group participants. For anchoring, the choice of method could also be improved. Impulsivity has not been tested: an improvement would be to give it a less descriptive role in order to more firmly justify its presence among the variables under study. "],["conclusion.html", "8 Conclusion", " 8 Conclusion The aims of this experiment were to demonstrate a significant difference in self-esteem, body acceptance and inpulsiveness scores between Non-Users and Tinder Users(assumed to be lower), and a greater impact of the manipulation on the experimental group of Tinder Users, highlinghting a less constant image of themselves, consistent with natural lower scores. It implicitly encompasses as well consistent results with the studied on which this present work is based on. The experiment used bogus feedbacks during the completion of the Rosenberger's Self-Esteem Scale page and an anchoring article before the Body Acceptance Scale page. Differences in scores are satisfactory for self-esteem scores and body acceptance score. Self-esteem scores are statistically different at 10% among Tinder Users and Non-Users, and the variation due to the treatment is significant as well. The results for Body Acceptance are mitigated: there is no statistical difference between Tinder Users and Non Users control groups, but the variation is significant for both experimental groups. Impulsiveness scores are statistically not different across all groups, no manipulation hving being design to affect this score. The models built, based on inverse.gaussian distribution, were not satisfactory as models, but confirm systematically self-esteem scores and body acceptance as only significant coefficients. We did not succeed to obtain a satisfactory modeling: the AICs were relatively high and the various Adjusted R-Squared is far lower than the threshold of 80% for satisfactory level (here around 30%). The presented regressions achieve to model only around 30% of the variation in the model. The neural network models, learners which are an alternative to a regression, have no ability to well categorize the participants. We compared the AIC and the Adjusted R-squared of the model again (instead of a confusion matrix) to have a point of comparison between the regressions and the learners. The limitations of the experimental design, of the sampling methodology and of data collection might explain the low insights from our data. The present experiment supports the lower level of self-esteem and a less robust self-esteem and body acceptance for Tinder Users than for Non-Tinder Users. The goals of this experiements were in this way partially reached: the modeling part bringing no satisfactory and thus generalizable information.
